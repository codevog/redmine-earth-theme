## Compatibility
This theme is compatible with the latest Redmine v2.x-3.x. It is tested and supported in major modern browsers like Chrome, Opera, Safari, Internet Explorer, and Firefox.

## Installation
* Download the theme.
* Unzip it into ../public/themes/. This would result in a directory-path to application.css like: 
../public/themes/RedmineEarthTheme/stylesheets/application.css
* Now you may need to restart Redmine so that it shows the newly installed theme in the list of available themes.
* Go to "Administration -> Settings" -> "Display" and select your newly created theme in the "Theme" drop-down list. Save your settings.
* Redmine should now be displayed using the selected theme.
